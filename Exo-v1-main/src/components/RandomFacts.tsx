  "Some exoplanets are so close to their stars that they may have surfaces of lava oceans.",
  "The Kepler Space Telescope discovered over 2,600 confirmed exoplanets.",
  "The TRAPPIST-1 system has seven Earth-sized planets, with three potentially in the habitable zone.",
  "Exoplanet J1407b has a ring system 200 times larger than Saturn's rings.",
  "55 Cancri e is thought to be covered in graphite and diamond, potentially making it a 'diamond planet'.",

  "NASA's TESS mission is designed to find thousands more exoplanets closer to Earth.",
  "Some 'rogue planets' don't orbit any star at all but float freely through space.",
  "The atmosphere of GJ 1214b is so hot and dense that it may contain 'hot ice' - water in a solid state due to pressure, despite high temperatures.",
  "The term 'exoplanet' was first used in the 1990s to refer to planets outside our solar system."
